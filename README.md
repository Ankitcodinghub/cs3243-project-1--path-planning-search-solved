Overview

In this project , you will implement search algorithms and heuristics to find valid paths to goals in a game. Specifically, you are tasked to implement the following algorithms to find a solution path in a maze:

1. Implement the Breadth-First Search (BFS).

2. Implement the Depth-First Search (DFS).

3. Implement Uniform-Cost Search (UCS).

4. Implement A‚àó Search (A‚àó).

This project is worth 10% of your module grade.

General Project Requirements

The general project requirements are as follows:

‚Ä¢ Individual Project

‚Ä¢ Python Version: 3.7

‚Ä¢ Submission folder: LumiNUS &gt; CS3243 &gt; Projects &gt; Project 1 Submission Folder

‚Ä¢ Submission format: One standard (non-encrypted) zip file containing only the necessary project files.

In particular, it should contain 1 folder with 4 .py files:

(BFS.py, DFS.py, UCS.py, AStar.py)

More info is given in the Submission Details section.

As to the specific project requirements, you must complete and submit the following:

‚Ä¢ Task 1 (BFS): Implement your BFS algorithm in BFS.py.

‚Ä¢ Task 2 (DFS): Implement your DFS algorithm in DFS.py.

‚Ä¢ Task 3 (UCS): Implement your UCS algorithm in UCS.py.

‚Ä¢ Task 4 (A‚àó): Implement your A‚àó algorithm in AStar.py.

Note that you are tasked to implement your own search space and state structure for the game. You can reuse the search space/state structure in all 4 search algorithms.

Background: Chess

Chess is an abstract strategy game and involves no hidden information. It is played on a square chessboard with 64 squares arranged in an 8√ó8 grid among two opposing players. At the start, each player (one controlling the white pieces, the other controlling the black pieces) controls sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. The objective of the game is to checkmate the opponent‚Äôs king, whereby the king is under immediate attack (in ‚Äùcheck‚Äù) and there is no way for it to escape. There are also several ways a game could end in a draw.

Figure 1: A layout of a chess board.

In this project, we will not be designing a game of chess. Instead, we will create a one-player game variant that utilitises a re-sizable chess board and a subset of the chess pieces, whilst introducing new objectives and obstacles to the game. In particular, we will not be using the pawn pieces in this project.

In the section below, the movement rules of each piece in the game is introduced and they should be strictly followed in the implementation of the game. Note that we are only concerned with the movement of each piece and not any other complex rules (e.g., castling)

Game Pieces

Each piece has its unique way of moving. In the diagrams below, the dots mark the squares to which the piece can move if there are no intervening piece(s) obstructing its path (except the knight, which leaps over any intervening pieces).

‚Ä¢ King: The king can move one square in any direction.

‚Ä¢ Rook: A rook can move any number of squares along a rank or file, but cannot leap over other pieces.

‚Ä¢ Bishop: A bishop can move any number of squares diagonally, but cannot leap over other pieces.

‚Ä¢ Queen: A queen combines the power of a rook and bishop and can move any number of squares along a rank, file, or diagonal, but cannot leap over other pieces.

‚Ä¢ Knight: A knight moves to any of the closest squares that are not on the same rank, file, or diagonal (thus the move forms an ‚ÄùL‚Äù-shape: two squares vertically and one square horizontally, or two squares horizontally and one square vertically). The knight is the only piece that can leap over other pieces.

‚Ä¢ Obstacle: An obstacle in the game has no moves and it takes up a square in the board. No other pieces can occupy the same position as the obstacle and they cannot leap over the obstacle (except the knight).

Figure 2: Movement of Chess Pieces

Game Board

A typical chess game is played on a square board with 64 squares arranged in an 8√ó8 grid. In this project, we relax the constraints on the board and allow the board size to be adjustable (e.g., we can create a 5√ó5 board, 7√ó6 board, 20√ó20 board).

The X-axis follows the ASCII character ordering staring from ‚Äôa‚Äô from the left, while the Y-axis follows the numerical ordering starting from 0 from the top. E.g., for an 10√ó10 grid, the X-axis is indexed as: ‚Äôa‚Äô, ‚Äôb‚Äô, ‚Äôc‚Äô, ‚Äôd‚Äô, ‚Äôe‚Äô, ‚Äôf‚Äô, ‚Äôg‚Äô, ‚Äôh‚Äô, ‚Äôi‚Äô, ‚Äôj‚Äô from the left to right, while the Y-axis is indexed as: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 from the top to bottom. These indices are to be used to represent the squares on the game board, e.g., the square on column ‚Äôa‚Äô and row 3 is represented as a3 in this text and (a,3) in the implementation. For this Project, we limit the maximum size of the X-axis to 26.

Action Costs

Implementation of Game Board and Game Pieces

Before implementing the search algorithms in the project, you will be required to design and implement your own game board and game pieces, including the movement of the pieces, the game state and the search space.

For each test case, you will be given an input text file (e.g. 1.txt) containing the board configuration (e.g., number of rows/columns, type of game pieces, starting position of game pieces, ending position of game pieces). You are required to parse the input text file and build the game board and its state.

Note that this step is important as your search algorithms in this project AND subsequent projects will make use of the design of your game board and game pieces.

Getting Started

You are given 4 python files (BFS.py, DFS.py, UCS.py, AStar.py) with recommended empty functions/classes to be implemented. Specifically, the following are given to you:

1. runBFS/DFS/UCS/AStar(): DO NOT REMOVE THIS FUNCTION. When called, this function must return a List of Moves and Number of Explored States. The returned output will be evaluated by the autograder to check correctness. For runUCS() and runAStar(), the function will also return the Path Cost on top of the list of moves and number of explored states.

You are encouraged to write other helper functions to aid you in implementing the algorithms. You are also encouraged, for all 4 python files, to use the same classes to design the game board and pieces (i.e., State, Board, Piece); only the implementation of search() should differ. During tests, When each of the 4 python files is executed, the method runXXX() will be called. The output should be a list of valid moves for the game and the number of explored states (as well as the path cost for UCS and AStar).

Finding a Valid Path using Search Algorithms

The objectives of this part of the project are:

1. To gain exposure in the implementation of search algorithms taught in class.

2. To learn to recognise the differences and utility of each search algorithm.

3. To learn to recognise the effects that the different search methods (uninformed and informed search) have on the performance and efficiency.

Project 1: King‚Äôs Maze

Oh no! The King of CS3243 is captured and trapped in a dungeon by his enemy kingdom, CS9999. The dungeon is filled with many obstacles and traps, with guards overlooking the place to prevent the King from escaping. However, as night approaches, the guards fall asleep in their positions, leaving the King an opportunity to escape the dungeon.

Now it‚Äôs time to write full-fledged generic search functions to help the King find his way! Remember that a search node must contain not only a state but also the information necessary to reconstruct the path (plan) which gets to that state.

Important note: All of your search functions need to return a list of actions that will lead the agent (King) from the start to the goal. These actions all have to be legal moves (valid movement rules of each piece, no movement through walls/obstacles).

Hint: Each algorithm is very similar. Algorithms for BFS, DFS, UCS, and A‚àó differ only in the details of how the frontier is managed. So, concentrate on getting BFS right and the rest should be relatively straightforward.

Background:

Furthermore, our King‚Äôs aim is to escape the dungeon and not fight the guards. Hence, our King piece cannot capture (i.e., remove) other enemy pieces on the board and it cannot visit squares inhabited by other pieces (of course, including obstacles).

We are also given the starting position of our King and the goal position(s) in the input file. To escape the dungeon, the King has to reach any of the goal position(s). The diagrams below show an example of an initial state and goal state of a game. The input file will also include information about costs.

Figure 4: An initial state of the game with the King at a0 as its starting position, with two enemy Kings at a3 and d5 and obstacles labelled as X. In this game, the given goal position is h7.

Figure 5: The goal state of the game with our King at h7.

Task 1: Breadth First Search

Implement the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm in BFS.py.

When the runBFS() function is executed in your code, your code should return a list of valid moves and the number of explored nodes in the following format: [move1,move2,move3,‚Ä¶,movelast], nodesExplored

where movei is a list containing two tuples: [Current Position tuple, Next Position tuple] and nodesExplored is an integer representing the number of nodes expanded in your search.

Each Position tuple contains 2 items ‚Äì the x and y index of the referenced square position, and is formatted as such: (posx,posy).

More specifically, the list of moves and number of nodes explored should be returned in this format:

[[(posx1,posy1),(posx2,posy2)],[(posx2,posy2),(posx3,posy3)],‚Ä¶[(posxi,posyi),(posxj,posyj)]], nodesExplored

An example of the function printed and its output is shown below:

print(runBFS())

Output:

([[(a,0),(b,0)],[(b,0),(c,0)],[(c,0),(d,0)],[(d,0),(e,1)],[(e,1),(d,2)]],125)

Task 2: Depth First Search

Implement the depth-first search (DFS) algorithm in DFS.py.

When the runDFS() function is executed in your code, your code should return a list of valid moves and the number of explored nodes in the following format: [move1,move2,move3,‚Ä¶,movelast], nodesExplored Details of movei and nodesExplored are as explained in Task 1.

An example of the function printed and its output is shown below:

print(runDFS())

Output:

([[(a,0),(b,0)],[(b,0),(c,0)],[(c,0),(d,0)],[(d,0),(e,1)],[(e,1),(d,2)]],125)

Task 3: Uniform Cost Search

Implement the uniform-cost search (UCS) algorithm in UCS.py. Note that your implementation should only require a few adjustments, taking into consideration the action cost and path cost.

When the runUCS() function is executed in your code, your code should return a list of valid moves, the number of explored nodes and the path cost in the following format: [move1,move2,move3,‚Ä¶,movelast], nodesExplored, pathCost

where movei is a list containing two tuples: [Current Position tuple, Next Position tuple], nodesExplored is an integer representing the number of nodes expanded in your search and pathCost is an integer representing the sum of the action cost of each move from the initial position to the goal position.

Each Position tuple contains 2 items ‚Äì the x and y index of the referenced square position, and is formatted as such: (posx,posy).

More specifically, the list of moves, number of nodes explored and path cost should be returned in this format:

[[(posx1,posy1),(posx2,posy2)],[(posx2,posy2),(posx3,posy3)],‚Ä¶[(posxi,posyi),(posxj,posyj)]],

nodesExplored, pathCost

An example of the function printed and its output is shown below:

print(runUCS())

Output:

([[(a,0),(b,0)],[(b,0),(c,0)],[(c,0),(d,0)],[(d,0),(e,1)],[(e,1),(d,2)]],125,64)

Task 4: A* Search

Implement A* search algorithm in AStar.py. Again, this should just be an extension of your previous search algorithms, with the addition of heuristics design and computation of h-cost, g-cost and f-cost.

When the runAStar() function is executed in your code, your code should return a list of valid moves, the number of explored nodes and the path cost in the following format: [move1,move2,move3,‚Ä¶,movelast], nodesExplored, pathCost Details of movei, nodesExplored and pathCost are as explained in Task 3.

An example of the function printed and its output is shown below:

print(runAStar())

Output:

([[(a,0),(b,0)],[(b,0),(c,0)],[(c,0),(d,0)],[(d,0),(e,1)],[(e,1),(d,2)]],125,64)

Remember, heuristics are just functions that take search states and return numbers that estimate the cost to a nearest goal. More effective heuristics will return values closer to the actual costs to the goal. Do recall the definitions of admissibility and consistency from the lectures and know what is required to achieve optimality under the different conditions.

Non-Trivial Heuristics: A trivial heuristic is one that always returns zero (analogous to UCS) and this will not save us any time. Also, a heuristic that computes the true cost to goal will cause the autograder to timeout. You want a heuristic which reduces total compute time; although for this assignment the autograder will only check node counts (aside from enforcing a reasonable time limit).

Invalid Goal State / No Goal

If no goal exists in the puzzle, there is no solution. In such cases, your 4 search algorithm implementations should return an empty list for your list of valid moves.

Grading Details

Your code will be graded for technical correctness. Please do not change the name of the runXXX() function.

There are 3 configuration files released to you via LumiNUS (together with the skeleton implementation files). These files serves as public testcases. There are additional private test cases that we will also run using your code (on CodePost). This is to prevent students from using brute-force and simply returning the results without implementing the search algorithms. Hence, to get the full credit for each task, you are required to pass all the public test cases and private test cases.

For each test case, the correctness of your code will be tested (e.g., returning a valid list of moves) and the time taken for the execution of your code will be measured as well. The time taken for your search algorithms will be compared to our solution‚Äôs benchmark. If the time taken for your code is above the time limit, it will be considered a failure of the test case. As such, you are encouraged to use efficient data structures when implementing your code (e.g. using a set/dictionary instead of a list). To account for the execution of code on different systems, we have provided additional buffers for the time limit.

For UCS and A*, the path cost returned by your algorithm will be compared with ours to determine if your search path is the optimal path.

In summary, to pass a test case, two conditions have to be fulfilled for BFS/DFS and three conditions have to be fulfilled for UCS/A*. They are:

1. Valid list of moves from start position to goal position.

2. Time taken to run your search is within our benchmark.

3. For UCS/A*: Path cost given by your search is the optimal path cost.

Hence, even if your implementation is technically correct but if the time taken is not within the threshold or if the path cost is not the optimal path cost for UCS/A*, the autograder will fail the test case.
